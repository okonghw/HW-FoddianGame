## Overview

This game simulates the rigorous, competitive experience of being a Harvard-Westlake student through physics-based platforming. 
With a simple movement mechanic and unforgiving gameplay, it’s easy to learn but hard to master. 
The game features a progression from 7th to 12th grade, each filled with obstacles that a typical HW student experiences 
and moments that reflect the HW experience.

---

## Target Audience

Harvard-Westlake students, as well as anyone who wants to know what it’s like to go to Harvard-Westlake School. 
The game appeals to the competitive HW students while also showing an exaggerated reflection of their daily struggles.

## Core Mechanics
2 Options (for now):

- **Default State: Sleep-Deprived**  
  You’re in a permanent state of exhaustion. Character movement is delayed or slightly sluggish.

- **Lock-In (Double Jump Mechanic)**  
  The only time you feel normal is when you "lock in." Lock-In gives you a moment of perfect clarity and control, 
  allowing a double jump and more precise movement.

- **Alternative Movement Mechanic**  
  You ride an electric scooter labeled **“Academic Validation”**. Lock-In remains the same.

## Game Structure

Players progress through grades 7-12, climbing higher and higher through levels themed around common school-year events such as:

- Orientation
- Homecoming
- Transition to Upper School
- Finals
- College App Season

Each section becomes more chaotic and difficult, reflecting the increasing pressure and burnout experienced by HW students. 
If the player falls, there’s not much to catch them, so the game is unforgiving of mistakes.

## Features

- Simple yet difficult to master movement system

## Engagement and Behavior

The game is Foddian-style, so it’s purely skill-based, difficult to progress, but easy to fall back down. 
However, players are encouraged to keep going through sheer determination and the satisfaction of being at the top of the 
leaderboard and the entire grade (becoming valedictorian at the end of the game). 
It mimics the real HW student experience of always pushing forward no matter how painful or ridiculous the climb.

The leaderboard adds a layer of competitiveness, fueling replayability/speedruns and the desire to flex one's perseverance and skill.

---

## Deployment Plan

The game will be built as a **web app** so it’s accessible on school laptops with no need to download anything. 
This makes it easy to share among classmates and quick to pick up during breaks or after school.

---

## Updates and Maintenance

Future plans include:

- Adding **Hard Mode** and **side quest levels** (e.g., winning a national competition)
- Launching first with **high school levels (10th–12th)**, then expanding to include **middle school levels (7th–9th)**
